                This websites helps you keep track of star spots in Mario Party! Now you may be wondering, what are star spots? 
                The way to win in Mario Party is having the most stars at the end of the game. To get these stars, you have to travel 
                around the board to get to the star and pay for it with coins. However, the places where the stars spawn are not random. 
                They spawn at specific spots on the map and are generally spaced out. The trick is that each time the star moves, the 
                star cannot spawn at a spot it has already been at unless the star has spawned at all spots then resetting, so by tracking star spots, 
                you can strategize your movement and have a higher probability to be closer to the star.
