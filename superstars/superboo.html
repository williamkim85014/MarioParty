                Horror Land has a 5 star difficulty rating and is dubbed the hardest board in all of Mario Party Superstars. There are 8 star spots across the board and there 
                are a lot of junctions so making correct decisions on paths is pivotal.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Gimmicks!
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are a lot of gimmicks on this board. This board's main gimmick is the day and night function that rotates every two turns. However, you can change 
                the time if you land on a happening space or you talk to either kamek at the mansion (to change it to night) or go to the dancing floor (to change it to day). 
                The main reason for the night and day time gimmicks is because there is an abnormal amount of boos on this board, and the boos are active depending on time. 
                If it's day time, only the boo at the bottom is active, and it is guarded by a skeleton gate. At night, the two boos on the left side and King Boo is active. 
                King Boo is guarded by a skeleton gate. King Boo is different from normal boo because King Boo has the power to take one star from all of your opponenets 
                for 3 times the cost (150 coins). He also lets you take coins from everyone for free, making King Boo a very overpowered entity. If you visit Mr. I, 
                he will take you all he way across the map, from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. for 6 coins during the day and 3 coins during the night. 
                Lastly, there are whomps in the way of junctions and if a whomp is blocking a desired path, then you have to pay 5 coins to move him. If it is a night, then 
                the whomps are frozen and that path is blocked until it becomes day.

            <p>
                I recommend stashing warp blocks in your inventory because it's a cheap way to travel between the islands and destroy your 
                opponents. I say this because there is a lot of variance with this board since the star could move at anytime, so having one 
                of these handy has a great chance of putting you in a great situation. Movement isn't that big of a deal since the board is 
                pretty small and you just cycle around for the most part; however, having movement items like mushrooms, double, and triple 
                dice blocks are definitely still useful and give less risk! Also curse blocks are really good on this map, but Bowser gives 
                a ton of these when you cross him, so I would recommend not getting them from the Item Shop.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Strategies!
            </h2>
            <p>
                I recommend not spending an obscene amount of coins at thowmps to mess with your opponents. Instead, I would just spend 
                the bear minimum to cross because there is so much variance. For example, you spend all of your coins to trap the other 
                opponents on the island without the star, and then someone lands on a happening space and moves the star. Now you are 
                locked on an island because you can't afford to go back. However, there are always situations where blocking is beneficial, 
                especially when there is a lot of coins in the coin economy. For example, blocking first place off an island can allow you to 
                catch up can be extremely good, especially since the coin star has changed to whoever collects the most coins, meaning you 
                do not have to save coins anymore. Also, curse blocking people to land on happening spaces is always a good way to get the 
                star moved. However, be careful you aren't giving away the happening star!
