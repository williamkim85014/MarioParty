                Horror Land has a 5 star difficulty rating and is dubbed the hardest board in all of Mario Party Superstars. There are 8 star spots across the board and there 
                are a lot of junctions so making correct decisions on paths is pivotal.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Gimmicks!
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are a lot of gimmicks on this board. This board's main gimmick is the day and night function that rotates every two turns. However, you can change 
                the time if you land on a happening space or you talk to either kamek at the mansion (to change it to night) or go to the dancing floor (to change it to day). 
                The main reason for the night and day time gimmicks is because there is an abnormal amount of boos on this board, and the boos are active depending on time. 
                If it's day time, only the boo at the bottom is active, and it is guarded by a skeleton gate. At night, the two boos on the left side and King Boo is active. 
                King Boo is guarded by a skeleton gate. King Boo is different from normal boo because King Boo has the power to take one star from all of your opponenets 
                for 3 times the cost (150 coins). He also lets you take coins from everyone for free, making King Boo a very overpowered entity. If you visit Mr. I, 
                he will take you all he way across the map, from the bottom right corner to the top left corner. for 6 coins during the day and 3 coins during the night. 
                Lastly, there are whomps in the way of junctions and if a whomp is blocking a desired path, then you have to pay 5 coins to move him. If it is a night, then 
                the whomps are frozen and that path is blocked until it becomes day.

                Board Layout!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Total: 55 Spaces!
                23 Blue Spaces
                5 Red Spaces
                11 Lucky Spaces
                7 Happening Spaces
                3 Item Spaces

            <h2>
                Best Items!
            </h2>
            <p>
                First off, I think all items for this board. For more consistency, I recommend prioritizing movement items like 
                mushrooms, double dice, and triple dice because this board is very large. Also, getting the custon dice block 
                can be very valuable for farming happening spaces and changing the time of day. Warp blocks are also very good 
                because there's a chance to switch with a person in an advantageous position. For example, if there is someone near 
                King Boo or on the Two Boo path, then taking a chance with the warp block is definitely worth it. Just make sure 
                you don't put a strong competitor in an advantageous position! However, I would still prioritze movement items and 
                custom block over warp block in the item shop due to the risk of the warp block. Lastly Skeleton Keys are super 
                valuable on this map. The Skeleton Gate on the bottom left leads to a boo during the day time, and the Skeleton 
                Gate on the upper right has King Boo during the night time. Having a Skeleton Key in your inventory adds a lot 
                of options to your strategy However, I wouldn't buy Skeleton Keys from the item shop unless it directly impacts 
                your strategy. Lucky Spaces are very common in this game, so it's likely that you will roll a Skeleton Key anyways.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Strategies!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Happening space farming is very important. It allows you the have control of the game by limiting boo encounters 
                for the other players, making custom block very important. Think of it like controlling the robber with 
                development cards in Catan. Your top priority is to be visiting boo as much as possible when you have coins built up. 
                Stealing stars is really crucial since coins are really easy to get in this game. If you are able to get 150 coins, 
                visiting King Boo when everyone has a star essentially guarantees the win.
