            Peach's Birthday Cake is a 3 Star map on Mario Party Superstars, and it is a map from the original Mario Party. This map is very linear in terms of gameplay 
            and is definitely a volatile map.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gimmicks!
        </h2>
        <p>
            You would think that if a map basically only has one path and one star spot would have like no gimmicks, however, that is entirely wrong. This map punishes 
            you if you have bad rolls or bad luck. The main thing is that there is only one star spot in this game, meaning whoever has the best dice rolls will generally 
            win the game. I say generally because the other main gimmick, which is Piranha Plant, can definitely ruin your game plan. How it works is that if a player 
            lands on an unoccupied happening space, they can plant a Piranha Plant. They can either Plant one that steals coins or plant one that steals a star. It's 
            usually in the players best interest to plant has many Piranha Plants as possible because they are able swing the game entirely if luck is in your favor. 
            Also, there is a junction where the players will plant a seed to see if they will continue to go on the path they are now, or go down the Bowser path. 
            The Bowser Path has some red spaces, battle, and chance time spaces making it a very voltile area to be on. Bowever himself steals coins and gives you an item 
            just like in Yoshi's Tropical Island. However, if you have a lot of coins, going on this path isn't that bad because it's closer to the star compared to 
            going on the normal path. Some differences from this board and the original Mario Party board is that they added slides. If you land on the happening space after 
            the star, you can slide down and skip the seeds and a lot of spaces, bringing you closer to the star. Another change is that they added an item shop on top of the 
            cake. In the original Mario Party, they didn't have items in the game.

        <h2>
            Board Layout!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Total: 55 Spaces!
            23 Blue Spaces
            5 Red Spaces
            11 Lucky Spaces
            7 Happening Spaces
            3 Item Spaces
            3 Bowser Spaces
            2 VS Spaces
            1 Chance Time Space
        </p>
        <h2>
            Best Items!
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Warp Block is definitely the best item for this board in my opinion. Because everyone is on the same path, if you are the farthest away from the 
            star, you can just use a warp block to guarantee that you will be closer to the star. Also, movement items are really good because it allows you to get 
            to the star faster. Just be careful and know that you are taking a risk because you can easily get warp blocked by an opponent, directly benefitting your 
            opponent while putting you in a bad spot. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Strategies!
        </h2>
        <p>
            There isn't really much strategy on this board because it's so linear. It's all about being lucky and out playing your opponents in minigames to have a lot of 
            coins. You need coins on this board to plant Piranha Plants. Stealing a star in this game is huge because it gives you a two star swing, especially if you 
            steal a star from first place. It's also very important to track happening space bonus star since there is so many happening spaces on this board. Also, I 
            recommend almost always buying a warp block from the item shop. It's just too valuable to pass up as it adds chaos in your favor to the board. If you go 
            down bowser path, it's not the end of world. It's pretty easy to earn coins in this game so losing coins isn't too detrimental, and it even puts you closer 
            to the star. Having a movement, item in this section allows you to skip the section (except Bowser) with relative ease, avoiding all of the red spaces, 
            the battle space, and the chance time space.
