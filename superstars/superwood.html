            Woody Woods is a 4 star board in Mario Party Superstars and is the only Mario Party 3 board in this series. Woody Woods 
            has a total of 10 star spots, and this is also my favorite board in the series.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gimmicks!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Woody Woods has a lot of gimmicks. The main mechanic utilizes junctions. At most junctions, there is a sign that points to one direction, and the 
            direction changes after each turn, Also, if a happening space that is associated to the sign is landed on, it switchs the direction at the end of 
            player's turn. Also, there are the two trees on the left side on the math. If a player lands on the happening space, the Woody (Green Tree) will either give 
            you a another roll or 5 coins, and Evil Woody (Purple Tree) will either give you a curse dice block or minus 5 coins. A key difference from Mario Party 3 and 
            Mario Party Superstars is the Skeleton Gate placements. Instead of going from up to down, they go down to up. For example, the top gate can take you to the 
            path on the Boo, skipping Evil Woody. Also, if you get unlucky and go down the wrong path, you can still access Boo. The bottom Skeleton Gate allows 
            you to guarantee access to the right path. Also, it gives access to a lucky space and a chance time space. Overall, the Skeleton Gate change is 
            very good, and it definitely makes Skeleton Keys valuable on this map. Also, there are 3 item shops on this map, which is an increase from Mario Party 3.

            Total: 91 Spaces!
            35 Blue Spaces, 
            7 Red Spaces, 
            15 Lucky Spaces, 
            9 Happening Spaces, 
            14 Item Spaces, 
            3 Bowser Spaces,

        <h2>
            Best Items!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the Reverse Mushroom from Mario Party 3 is not in this game, making navigating junctions a lot more difficult. I definitely recommend 
            movement items for this map, and with so many item shops and items spaces, it's definitely not hard to get. Also, Warp Blocks are a decent option. 
            There are so many junctions that usually only one person in a good position for the star at a time. A one third chance isn't consistent enough, but this map 
            has so much variance that a Warp Block will always have a use. Curse Dice Blocks also have a use. If you want to slow yourself down and wait for the 
            signs to switch, then using a curse mushroom on yourself is smart. Also, using a curse mushroom on your opponents to force them on a path is a smart move. 
            However, buying a Curse Dice Block from the store may be a waste since movement items should be prioritized, especially since you can get Curse Dice Blocks 
            from item spaces.

            Strategies!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Well obviously tracking happening spaces is super important since there is a lot of happening spaces on the board. Also, it's very difficult to line up 
            your movement perfectly because the signs have so much variance and there is many signs. Having a Skeleton Key in hand will always be nice because it adds 
            consistency. Because it's very difficult to get stars on this board, hitting boo as much as possible to steal stars from opponents is a viable strategy. 
            Using the mole can be a good choice to mess with your opponents while also adding chaos. Overall, this board is super chaotic. It's very important to win 
            minigames to have a lot of coins and get happening star.
