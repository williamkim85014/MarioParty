            Yoshi's Tropical Island is a one star difficulty board on Mario Party Super Stars. Originating from the original Mario Party, 
            this board doesn't have many gimmicks and has no star spots to keep track of since the star just alternates between two spots.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gimmicks!
        </h2>
        <p>
            There isn't many gimmicks on this board as this is the most simple board in the whole game. There are only two star spots on 
            the board, one on each island. The star moves between these two spots when a happening space is landed on. 
            To treverse these two islands, you have to pass by a Thwomp and pay coins. However, the amount paid to cross will continue 
            to increase proportional to the number of coins invested by the players, meaning if someone pays 49 coins to cross, the 
            price is now 50 coins in order to cross! However, the maximum amount of coins to cross the thwomp is 50 coins so add that to 
            your future strategies!
        </p>

            Total: 55 Spaces!
            23 Blue Spaces
            5 Red Spaces
            11 Lucky Spaces
            7 Happening Spaces
            3 Item Spaces

        <h2>
            Best Items!
        </h2>
        <p>
            I recommend stashing warp blocks in your inventory because it's a cheap way to travel between the islands and destroy your 
            opponents. I say this because there is a lot of variance with this board since the star could move at anytime, so having one 
            of these handy has a great chance of putting you in a great situation. Movement isn't that big of a deal since the board is 
            pretty small and you just cycle around for the most part; however, having movement items like mushrooms, double, and triple 
            dice blocks are definitely still useful and give less risk! Also curse blocks are really good on this map, but Bowser gives 
            a ton of these when you cross him, so I would recommend getting them from the store.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Strategies!
        </h2>
        <p>
            I recommend not spending an obscene amount of coins at thowmps to mess with your opponents. Instead, I would just spend 
            the bear minimum to cross because there is so much variance. For example, you spend all of your coins to trap the other 
            opponents on the island without the star, and then someone lands on a happening space and moves the star. Now you are 
            locked on an island because you can't afford to go back. However, there are always situations where blocking is beneficial, 
            especially when there is a lot of coins in the coin economy. For example, blocking first place off an island can allow you to 
            catch up can be extremely good, especially since the coin star has changed to whoever collects the most coins, meaning you 
            do not have to save coins anymore. Also, curse blocking people to land on happening spaces is always a good way to get the 
            star moved. However, be careful you aren't giving away the happening star!
