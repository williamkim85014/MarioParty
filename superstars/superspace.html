            Space Land is a 2 star difficulty board in Mario Party Superstars! This board was originally from Mario Party 2 and has 8 star spots! This map 
            has a lot of paths, so it's very important to be on the most optimal path while avoiding the Bowser Coin Beam!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gimmicks!
        </h2>
        <p>
            The main gimmick in this map is the Bowser Coin Beam! There is the main junction in the middle and everytime it someone crosses it, the counter goes 
            down by one. When the counter reaches zero, the Bowser Coin Beam fires and everyone on the diagonal line going from top-right to bottom-left gets hit, 
            losing all of their coins. After this, the counter resets back to 5. Next is the movement option. If a happening space is landed on the edge of the map, 
            then a Thwomp or a Whomp will chase after you and all the other players on that path to the other corner. if you pay 5 coins, the Snufit will set a speed 
            trap. Now, if someone lands on a happening space, the Thwomp or the Whomp will chase you down two edges, bringing everyone on the path with you. Lastly, 
            the Skeleton Gates are actually not bad on this map. The Skeleton Gate that is top left is a very good option. It allows you to cut through to the middle, 
            conserving turns, but more importantly, there is boo on this path. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Board Layout!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Total: 95 Spaces!
            40 Blue Spaces. 
            9 Red Spaces, 
            15 Lucky Spaces, 
            5 Happening Spaces, 
            15 Item Spaces, 
            3 Bowser Spaces, 
            4 VS Spaces, 
            2 Chance Time Spaces, 
            2 Bank Spaces
        </p>
        <h2>
            Best Items!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Movement items are definitely the best items for this board because the board is so big and there are a lot of options. Triple Dice blocks are definitely 
            the best because it allows you to go the farthest in one turn. Warp blocks are pretty bad on this map because there are so many options to get to one place 
            so it's more likely that you will put yourself in a disadvantage then benefitting from it. Curse blocks can be used to destory your opponent by not letting 
            him or her escape the laser. This could be a strategy if an opponent has a lot of coins. Using a golden dice block is also a good choice because 
            there are specific spaces that you want to land on and also boost your happening space count. Having a Skeleton Key in hand is also a pretty smart strategy.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Strategies!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Space land is all about movement strategy since there are so many junctions and the amount of spaces you move. Don't be afraid to be in the Bowser 
            Coin Beam range because even if you get hit, losing all of your coins is bad, but it won't ruin your game plan since it is very easy to earn coins in this 
            game. Utilize the Thwomps and the Whomps as it can definitely put your opponents in a bad situation. Using a Golden Dice Block to land on that space can 
            boost your happening space count as well. Also, using a Skeleton Key on the top-left gate is a good strategy because boo is on that path. Also, that Skeleton 
            Gate puts you in a very good position to hit the other boo on the right path. If you have over a 100 coins, you could steal two stars in two turns if you use 
            triple dice.
