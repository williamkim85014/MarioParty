            Space Land is a 2 star difficulty board in Mario Party Superstars! This board was originally from Mario Party 2 and has 8 star spots! This map 
            has a lot of paths, so it's very important to be on the most optimal path while avoiding the Bowser Coin Beam!
        </p>
        <h2>
            Gimmicks!
        </h2>
        <p>
            The main gimmick in this map is the Bowser Coin Beam! There is the main junction in the middle and everytime it someone crosses it, the counter goes 
            down by one. When the counter reaches zero, the Bowser Coin Beam fires and everyone on the diagonal line going from top-right to bottom-left gets hit, 
            losing all of their coins. After this, the counter resets back to 5. Next is the movement option. If a happening space is landed on the edge of the map, 
            then a Thwomp or a Whomp will chase after you and all the other players on that path to the other corner. if you pay 5 coins, the Snufit will set a speed 
            trap. Now, if someone lands on a happening space, the Thwomp or the Whomp will chase you down two edges, bringing everyone on the path with you. Lastly, 
            the Skeleton Gates are actually not bad on this map. The Skeleton Gate that is top left is a very good option. It allows you to cut through to the middle, 
            conserving turns, but more importantly, there is boo on this path.

        <h2>
            Best Items!
        </h2>
        <p>
            I recommend stashing warp blocks in your inventory because it's a cheap way to travel between the islands and destroy your 
            opponents. I say this because there is a lot of variance with this board since the star could move at anytime, so having one 
            of these handy has a great chance of putting you in a great situation. Movement isn't that big of a deal since the board is 
            pretty small and you just cycle around for the most part; however, having movement items like mushrooms, double, and triple 
            dice blocks are definitely still useful and give less risk! Also curse blocks are really good on this map, but Bowser gives 
            a ton of these when you cross him, so I would recommend getting them from the store.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Strategies!
        </h2>
        <p>
            I recommend not spending an obscene amount of coins at thowmps to mess with your opponents. Instead, I would just spend 
            the bear minimum to cross because there is so much variance. For example, you spend all of your coins to trap the other 
            opponents on the island without the star, and then someone lands on a happening space and moves the star. Now you are 
            locked on an island because you can't afford to go back. However, there are always situations where blocking is beneficial, 
            especially when there is a lot of coins in the coin economy. For example, blocking first place off an island can allow you to 
            catch up can be extremely good, especially since the coin star has changed to whoever collects the most coins, meaning you 
            do not have to save coins anymore. Also, curse blocking people to land on happening spaces is always a good way to get the 
            star moved. However, be careful you aren't giving away the happening star!
